## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- All client API routes properly authenticated with NextAuth
- Consistent authentication pattern across all endpoints
- Session-based access control
- Secure cookie handling

### Type Safety
- No use of `any` types (as per project guidelines)
- Proper Prisma client types
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Type-safe API responses

### Database Integration
- All routes integrated with Prisma ORM
- Proper relation handling (Client ‚Üí Visit ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Module)
- Optimized queries with proper includes
- Transaction support where needed

### UI/UX
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- Consistent styling with ShadCN UI components
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessibility considerations
- Modern, clean interface

### API Design
- RESTful conventions
- Consistent response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error messages in Spanish (for end users)
- Query parameter support for filtering

---

## üìä Database Schema Alignment

All API routes were aligned with the actual Prisma schema:

**Visit Model Fields Used:**
- `startedAt` (not `checkInTime`)
- `finishedAt` (not `checkOutTime`)
- `module` relation (not `agentModule`)
- Proper status enums

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Registration Flow
- [  ] Register new client
- [  ] Upload documents during registration
- [  ] Verify admin notification
- [  ] Admin approves/rejects registration
- [  ] Client receives notification

#### Client Portal
- [  ] Login as client
- [  ] View dashboard
- [  ] Update profile information
- [  ] View visit history
- [  ] Filter visits by status
- [  ] Upload new document
- [  ] View document status
- [  ] Use chat interface
- [  ] Check notifications

#### API Endpoints
```bash
# Profile
GET /api/client/profile
PATCH /api/client/profile

# Visits
GET /api/client/visits?status=COMPLETED&limit=10

# Stats
GET /api/client/stats

## üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 5)

The next phase will focus on:

1. **Chatbot Integration**
   - Integrate Anthropic Claude API
   - Connect existing MCP tools
   - Implement conversation management
   - Add context awareness

2. **AI Features**
   - Semantic FAQ search
   - Intent recognition
   - Multi-turn conversations
   - Context retention

3. **Enhanced Chat UI**
   - Typing indicators
   - Message reactions
   - File attachments
   - Code formatting

---

## üìù Notes

### Current Limitations (To Be Addressed)
1. Client authentication currently shares User auth system (needs separate client auth)
2. Document storage is mocked (needs real file storage solution - S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
3. Notifications are mocked (needs real notification system)
4. Chat bot responses are mocked (will be replaced with Claude in Phase 5)

### Mock Data Usage
Several endpoints return mock data for demonstration:
- Client profile (uses session email)
- Notifications
- Chat responses
- Some statistics

These will be replaced with real data as the system develops.
